# Welcome To My Blog

I did it again.

My first blog was a German tech blog called _Go DEV!_ and I posted on it from August 2011 until Juli 2014 with two final posts in April and March 2016.

I will write about whatever keeps me currently busy with a strong focus on computer science and related topics.
