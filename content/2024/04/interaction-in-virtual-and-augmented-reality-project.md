This is my report for my university project for the course Interaction in Virtual and Augmented Reality.


## Motivation

We have been given an existing VR project. In this virtual environment exists a race track through a city. Along the way are collectable coins. The race track is structured in three different areas. Shortly before a new area, a task has to be done, at which a T-shaped object has be selected and be moved in the second T-shaped object. Ideally, those two T-objects are then exactly at the same position with the same rotation, so that you can't distingish them anymore.

We had the following tasks:
  * Implement a locomotion method
  * Implement a method that allows selection, moving and rotation of the T-objects
  * Implement something that reduces cyber-sickness
  * Design and execute a study to evalute the results
